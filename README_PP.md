# XRAY & ACRONIS Gui and api Automation framework
Web Testing with Playwright in Python


## Abstract

Everybody gets frustrated when web apps are broken,
but testing them thoroughly doesn't need to be a chore.
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/python/),
a new open-source browser automation tool from Microsoft,
makes testing web apps fun!
Playwright outperforms other browser automation with a slew of nifty features
like automatic waiting, mobile emulation, and network interception.
Plus, with isolated browser contexts,
Playwright tests can set up *much* faster than traditional Web UI tests.

In self PROJECT, we built a [Python](https://www.python.org/)
test automation project from the ground up using Playwright.
I automated web tests together step-by-step
using Playwright for interactions and pytest for execution.
I also implemented Playwright features
capturing traces,videos,screenshots and logs
This 3 layered framework empoweres the user to test modern web apps with modern web test tools.
The user is given also a good example project to be the foundation for your future tests.


## What is Playwright?

Playwright is a fairly new test automation framework from Microsoft.
It is open source, and it has bindings in TypeScript/JavaScript, Python, .NET, and Java.
Some of the nice features Playwright offers include:

* concise, readable calls
* easy out-of-the-box setup
* very fast execution times (compared to other browser automation tools)
* cross-browser and mobile emulation support
* automatic waiting
* screenshots and video capture
* built-in API calls

Microsoft is actively developing Playwright,
so new features are coming all the time!


## This readme is based on a TUTORIAL & workshop at the following events:
README & Turorial has six main parts, each with three sections:

1. Getting started
   1. What is Playwright?
   2. Our web search test
   3. Test project setup
2. First steps with Playwright
   1. Browsers, contexts, and pages
   2. Navigating to a web page
   3. Performing a search
3. Writing assertions
   1. Checking the search field
   2. Checking the result links
   3. Checking the title
4. Refactoring using page objects
   1. The search page
   2. The result page
   3. Page object fixtures
5. Nifty Playwright tricks
   1. Testing different browsers
   2. Capturing screenshots and videos
   3. Running tests in parallel
6. Testing with APIs
   1. API setup
   2. Writing a pure API test
   3. Writing a hybrid UI/API test


## Prerequisites

You must have basic Python programming skills to Work with the project code.
If you are new to Python, check out the free
[Python Programming](https://testautomationu.applitools.com/python-tutorial/) course
on Test Automation University.

Your machine must also have Python 3.11 or higher installed.
You can download the latest version of Python from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/).

You should also Use
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)
or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

The prefered is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/).

If you wish to complete Part 6 ("Testing with APIs"),
then you will need a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.
