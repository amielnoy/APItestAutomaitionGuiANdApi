(Someone guessed the Chargers\' bolt stood for "Lightning McQueen.")\nWhereas virtually every NFL franchise produced some sort of slick video to roll out its slate of games, the Titans stole the show with their rough-hewn clips shot with a smartphone and a lapel microphone. Actually, Tennessee made one of those highly produced videos too, but wanted more of a Gen-Z offering for various social media platforms.\nPeople are also reading\nNapaStat | $17.95 million: That\'s the price of Napa Countys most expensive home sold in April\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the viral street video had 9.3 million views on Twitter, 4.8 million on TikTok, 1.4 million on Instagram and 436,000 on Facebook.\n"Not to brag," said Gil Beverly, chief marketing and strategy officer for the Titans, "but we kind of created a moment."\nBeverly credited a trio of twentysomethings in the front office  Emily Starkey, Katie Moseley and Jeanette Morley  for coming up with the idea and shooting the video. Nate Bain, who came from the Rams, is the team\'s director of social media.\nStarkey, Moseley and Morley spent eight hours over two days talking to people around the time Taylor Swift was in town for a concert. Apparently, the Venn diagram of NFL fans and Swifties has some areas that don\'t overlap.\nAmong the more amusing guesses, the Atlanta Falcons were the "Red Stallions," Cincinnati Bengals were the "Boston Bobcats," the New Orleans Saints were the "St. Louis Rams," and a group of young women confidently proclaimed the Indianapolis Colts horseshoe stood for  the Dallas Cowboys.\nWhat made the video hilarious was after each blind stab, the Titans would announce the actual game  over the soundtrack of the triumphant trill of the Fox NFL theme song  using the goofy guess.\nSo the Nov. 2 game against Pittsburgh was announced as a matchup with the "49ers 69ers Stars," the Nov. 12 game versus Tampa Bay is against the "Pirates from the Islands of the Caribbean." The division-rival Jacksonville Jaguars are either "Chester Cheeto" or "Actually Does Not Exist," and the Seattle Seahawks are the "Eagles Eagles Eagles from Pittsburgh."\nOne young man described the Cleveland Browns as "Just the Football Logo," although a guess that didn\'t make the cut was the "Ohio Eights."\nAt the end, of course, all the fans could identify the Tennessee Titans.\nAfter the video was released, some of the teams involved played along. The Falcons even changed their social media handle to the Red Stallions, and the Colts briefly changed their name on Twitter to "not the Cowboys."\n"I saw a local T-shirt company that\'s already making a T-shirt with all the fake names," Beverly said. "It\'s a 15-minutes-of-fame kind of thing, and this one seems to have a little bit of legs to it, and we\'re going to enjoy it while it lasts."\nTags', 'snippet': '... spent eight hours over two days talking to people around the time <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> was in town for a concert.

Other Swifties weighed in with the answer in the comments, suggesting shed said, Hi James! Hi Nezzy! The Twitter account Taylor Swift News agreed, sharing it with the message, Taylor saying hi to Blake and Ryans children James and Inez whilst on stage.\nAside from the onstage moment at the Philadelphia show, fans saw the two Lively-Reynolds kids backstage with their mom, according to\nPeople\n. The girls were reportedly holding hands with Swift on her way out, waving goodbye to fans. Their two younger sisters missed out, which is fitting given that Betty is just 3 and the baby was born in February.\nSwift is famously close to Lively, Reynolds, and the four children they now have. She used James and Inezs names, plus Bettys for her 2020 song Betty. They even got a shoutout when she won Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards, along with their parents, whom she called the second and third people I play every new song that I write [for], per MTV News.\nThe girls parents think its pretty d*mn amazing that Swift used their names in Betty, Reynolds said during a SiriusXM interview in August 2021.

It was in this hallowed space (initially built as a carriage house in 1870) where, as Swift sings, she memorized the creaks in the floor. The going theory among Swifties is that the song documents Swifts early romance with her ex Joe Alwyn.\nIn the song, Swift reveals that if you ever walk away, Id never walk Cornelia Street again. Now, one month after the couple split, the apartment is back in the spotlight as its real estate broker drums up publicity in TMZ. All this can be yours, for $45,000 per month.\nThis is Swifts lot in life, so to speak. Much like anything else that celebrities do these days, real estate has become subject to constant reporting. In an era when many millennials with lingering memories of marathoning Cribs now spend their time wistfully scrolling through Zillow, real estate has also become a part of celebrities brands.\nSwifts notoriously plush real estate portfoliowhich the Wall Street Journal tallied at $150 million earlier this yearhas helped tell her story for more than a decade. Theyve helped define her aesthetic and become part of her lore. Through the years, the singer has woven her homes and their own histories into her music and, conversely, used her real estate purchases to weave herself into their histories too.\nSince the beginning of her career, Swifts so-called authenticity has been at the heart of her detractors skepticismand wealth has long played a part in sowing that mistrust. In spite of the \nunderdog\n narrative that the singer cultivated early in her career, some critics pointed out that she was born into considerable money: Her mother is a former marketing manager, and her father, a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, descends from three generations of bank presidents, according to the New Yorker. An aptly titled 2016 post from The Ringer asked, When Did You First Realize Taylor Swift Was Lying to You?\nIt should come as no surprise, given her family history, that as Swifts album sales rose, she began to park some of that cash into real-estate investments.\nBeverly Hills (and Nashville): Thats where Taylor wants to be\nEver the industrious one, Swift made her first purchase at age 20, when the Wall Street Journal reports that she purchased her Nashville condo on Nashvilles Music Row for $2.377M in 2009.\nSwift cobbled her 5,000 square-foot starter home together by purchasing two unitsa construction endeavor to which she would later return, much to the consternation of some of her neighbors in Tribeca years later.\nThe eye-catching abode, seen in Swifts 2020 Netflix documentary Miss Americana, was basically the godmother of grand-millennial design. Swifts zest for something different from everywhere else I seedescribed by journalist Jody Rosen for Vulture as an eye-popping cacophony of patterned wallpaper and fabricsforetold current interior design trends toward all things vintage and maximalist and helped solidify her accessible, lightly quirky girl brand.\nAs Swift picked out tiles and wallpapers in 2009, she described her decorative instincts as whimsical quirky eclectic tree house. Four years later, Rosen described the final product as a Shabby-Chic Alice in Wonderland.\nIn 2010, Swifts star soared with Speak Nowwhich defied downward trends in album sales and sold 1,047,000 copies in the US in its first week. The triumph of Swifts album ushered in a new chapter in her real estate story as well. Well call 2011 her Ive arrived era.\nThat year, Swift bought her first home in Beverly Hills. In keeping with her dreamy, proto-cottagecore brand, Swift managed to find perhaps the only Cape Cod-style home in the 90210 for $3.55 million, the Journal reports. Swift also bought a $2.5 million mansion for her parents in 2011a Greek Revival structure called the Northumberland Estate. (Our Tay-Tay really loves her idiosyncratic architectural styles!) A year later, Swift dropped another $1.775  million for a second house in Beverly Hills to use for guestsyou know, as one does.\nWhen Swift finally welcomed Vogue to her home for a round of \n73 Questions\n in 2016, she did so at her Beverly Hills estate. The wallpaper was out in full force, and apparently T-Swift keeps a VMA trophy next to her coffee maker. The garden? Stunning. The accents feel like a throwback to the days when Pier 1 was it for suburban interior design, and the lighting is warm and cozy. It was all perfectly curated, and it all screamed Taylor Swift.\nPut together, the Nashville and Beverly Hills properties solidified Swifts purchasing power and demonstrated what her fans and savvy critics already knew: She wasnt going anywhere.\nTaylor moves inand outof Cape Cod\nThen came the time Swift dated a Kennedy. In August 2012, months before she released her smash album Red and six weeks into her relationship with Conor Kennedy, Swift bought a $4.9 million home on Cape Cod, across the street from the Kennedy compound. In the book The Kennedy Heirs, a friend of Conors said that Swifts purchase made him nervous: It seemed as if she was getting a little too attached, spending five million bucks on a house just to be near the guy.\nChatter about Swifts dating life was at its most pervasive around the time Red debuted. By then, shed dated a string of A-listers, including Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Taylor Lautner, and Harry Styles, and woven many of them into some of her best songs.\nIn retrospect, Swifts brief stint in the Cape Cod beach homeand the discussion around itfeels like a relic from the bygone era before Blank Space, when gossip about her relationships was as pervasive as reviews of her music. In the end, however, Swift got the last laugh on this one; as quickly as she sold her coastal pad, she still walked away with an $870 million profit.\nMiss Taymerica\nPerhaps the most crucial real estate investment of Swifts career so far came in 2013, when she bought her Rhode Island mansion for $17.75 million. This would become the stage for the brand-defining tradition Taymerica. The annual Fourth of July event first made news in 2014, thanks in part to the rise of Swifts Girl Squad.\nThis was the time of Bad Blood, Mad Max-style costumes, and power in girlbossy numbers. The Girl Squad was Swift at her most controversial, and Taymerica was its nexus.

They sold out before general public could even try to buy one.\nHowever, two Bay Area moms scored tickets on StubHub for their 13 year old daughters-and excitement ran high - until it turned to heartbreak.\n"Every day we\'d say, get the tickets, get the tickets, we wanted them so bad,\'\' 13-year-old Olivia Schuman recalled.\nThe young teen and her friend since birth, Sasha Malek, have been Taylor Swift fans nearly their entire lives. Now, their mothers are fans too.\nSo, when they heard the superstar was going on tour this year, the two moms decided to take their daughters to see her in concert.\n"To have your 13-year-old daughters want to do anything like this with their mothers, and be excited, it\'s like seeing yourself through them,\'\' said Olivia\'s mom, Isabelle Schuman, who is also longtime friends with Sasha\'s mom.\n"We both like Taylor Swift. Our daughters like it, I thought it would be fun,\'\' Schuman recalled. "I said, are you in? Let\'s go to L.A., a girl\'s trip."\nMORE:\nThe tour had sold out in minutes last November, so Schuman went to the StubHub secondary marketplace and bought four tickets to the show in Los Angeles, their seats not far from the stage.\nExctement quickly grew.\n"They\'re already talking about what outfit they wanted to wear, and what we should wear, and how we\'re gonna do heir hair,\'\' Schuman said. "Apparently when you go to a Taylor Swift concert you dress up in the clothes that go with the theme of her albums."\n"We\'re gonna do this, like, glitter heart around our eye,\'\' Olivia said, tracing a heart shape with her finger around one eye.\n"We got airline tickets, we booked a hotel, the girls were super excited and so were we."\nBut six months later, a crushing letdown.\n"StubHub came to us and said ...we don\'t have tickets for you," Schuman recalled\nMORE:\nSix months after she bought and paid for the tickets, Isabelle received an email from StubHub saying "We apologize, but unfortunately your seller is not able to provide the tickets you originally purchased."\n"I was shocked,\'\' Schuman said "Why are they just telling us now six months later?"\nSuddenly, they had no tickets. And no explanation. Just disappointed teens and wasted airline tickets.\nStubHub\'s Fan Protection Guarantee says if a sale falls through, fans are entitled to a full refund, or "comparable-or-better tickets."\nBut "comparable" means a similar price - and at the current, going rates. And of course Taylor Swift ticket prices have skyrocketed since Schuman bought her tickets back in November.\nShe\'d paid $3,400 for four seats including fees last November. Right now, comparable seats listed for anywhere from $13,000 to $17,000, including StubHub fees, for the Los Angeles date.\n"Why did I buy my ticket six months ago,\'\' Schuman said. "There\'s no guarantee. Yeah, get my money back, but you\'re not guaranteed your ticket.\nMORE:\nNow I had to go back and tell the girls, they were disappointed. Sad."\n"It was upsetting, it just felt not fair,\'\' Sasha\'s mother Jessica said.\nSchuman complained by direct message to StubHub saying,  "We aren\'t even guaranteed to get tickets. How do you tell a 13-year-old that?"\nStubHub replied, "Regrettably, we are required to follow our policies...the section you purchased has gone up three times what you paid. We can\'t issue replacements. Unfortunately I cannot guarantee tickets."\n"They said they have no control,\'\' Schuman said. ...it\'s the seller. It\'s coming from the seller"\nSchuman had planned to present the tickets to Olivia at her bat-mitzvah this month. Now there were no tickets at all.\nShe contacted ABC7, and 7 On Your Side team asked StubHub how it allows a seller to renege on the sale of tickets.\nStubHub said sellers do face penalties if they remove a ticket from the platform after it\'s been sold. They also are not allowed to cancel a sale and then raise the price, which is what Schuman suspected was happening, since it\'s possible to fetch a much higher price for those seats.\nThe fan guarantee does not include replacing tickets at a higher price.\nWhich means it\'s not always possible to count on those seats.\nMORE:\n\'Excruciating for me\': Taylor Swift speaks out on Instagram after Ticketmaster cancels general sale\nHowever, StubHub did take action.\n"An hour and a half (after contacting ABC7), I got a phone call from StubHub,\'\' Schuman recalled. "They were gonna help me out."\nStubHub came through with four seats in a section similar to their good seats nearer the stage -- for no extra cost. And at the bat mitzvah party, Schuman handed Olivia and Sasha an envelope.\n"Girls there\'s something exciting for you,\'\' Schuman told them.\n"What is it?"  the girls replied.\nThey opened the envelope, precious tickets were tucked inside. Joyful shrieks erupted from the group. (see video)\n"ABC7 helped us," the moms said. "Thank you, ABC7!"\nStubHub could not say why the seller did not release the tickets, or if the person was hoping to fetch a higher price.\nStubHub says it does penalize sellers who fail to provide tickets after they\'re sold, or who cancel a sale and then raise the price.\nOur thanks to StubHub for the new tickets. The girls are thrilled.\nTake a look at more stories and videos by\nMichael Finney and 7 On Your Side.\n7OYS\'s consumer hotline is a free consumer mediation service for those in the San Francisco Bay Area.
