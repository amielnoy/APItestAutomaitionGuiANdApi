Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married. Swift has been ruling the music industry for years and is behind numerous chartbuster songs such as Blank Space, Lover, Anti-Hero, and Enchanted.    Notably, her opening three-hour concert in March was attended by 70,000 people, breaking a record held by Madonna for the most-attended female concert in US history. Madonna's concert took place at Anaheim Stadium in 1987 and was attended by 62,986 people. 807", 'snippet': '... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> will possibly rank high up ... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> would possibly rank high on the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2023-05-21T10:25:14', 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l28820230521113532.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/meet-davis-perrigo-accountant-by-profession-swiftie-by-passion/story'}}, {'id': '3638057967356410941', 'title': 'Keith Urban dubs Taylor Swifts Eras Tour as best of the best', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/488544-keith-urban-dubs-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-as-best-of-the-best', 'description': 'Keith Urban attended Taylor Swifts Eras Tour with wife Nicole Kidman last weekend in Philadelphia', 'body': 'Keith Urban was all praises for Taylor Swifts\nEras Tour\nas she enjoyed her recent show with wife Nicole Kidman.\nIn an exclusive conversation with\nPeople Magazine\n, the country musician, 55, talked about attending Swifts latest show in Philadelphia on Sunday, May 14th, 2023.\nWe had the best time, Urban told the outlet.

In my opinion, they should not wait until the day before tickets are sent by the seller.\nStubHub, a third party ticket exchange and reseller, has a policy whereby tickets are not sent to the purchaser until after the day before the event and replacement tickets are not available.\nAlmost $21,000, for better seats but of course you can see that sets me back quite a bit, Silva told the outlet.  I think it is for no reason other than incompetence through the third party or through StubHub.\nSilva, who also rented a limousine for the all-inclusive experience, was having fun at Catelynns expense before telling her about the newly acquired tickets.\nWe played a prank on them by telling them yesterday, telling them the tickets were already gone, and the look on their faces I never want to see again. One girl had a trembling lip, said Silva.\nAnthony Silva originally spent about $1,800 on the four tickets last November on StubHub, a ticket selling site, but they were never delivered and the company told him replacement seats were not available.\nWCVB\nKatelyn Silva said she was very angry and frustrated about the ticket incident because Ive been looking forward to this for nine months.\nWCVB\nCatelyn is disappointed to discover the tickets have not been delivered, causing a small tantrum over the fiasco.\nShe told the outlet, I came home playing stuff, I was so angry, so disappointed because I had been looking forward to this for nine months.\nSwift is set to spend three nights at Gillette Stadium, home of the NFLs New England Patriots, where 200,000 fans are packed. He is expected to attend.\nThe Friday show received more than 60,000 people. According to CBS.\nTicketmaster canceled Swifts The Eras Tour general audience sale in November, claiming historically unprecedented demand for pre-sale events.\nDue to extremely high demands on ticketing systems and insufficient stock of tickets remaining to meet this demand, TOMORROW ON SALE FOR Taylor Swift | Eras Tour CANCELED, the ticket company tweeted at the time.\nKatelyn Silva (R) and her friends were able to attend the concert, thanks to her dads hefty spending.\nInstagram\nSilva paid $21,000 on another sellers site for Swifts Saturday show that his daughter and her friends have their hearts set on in Gillettes court.\nGetty Images for TAS Rights Mana\nTwenty-five Swift fans took legal action against Ticketmaster in December, suing the company for fraud and intentional misrepresentation in the wake of the fiasco.\nLikewise, other Swift fans have been burned by the third-party ticketing site.\nA Maryland family had to shell out $2,100 when their tickets to a concert last weekend in Philadelphia werent delivered  compared to $700 initially paid.\nI wanted Taylor Swift to be my first party, said 15-year-old Leila Mahoney.

She enjoys a massive global following, and it's not uncommon for fans to go to unimaginable lengths to catch her glimpse.    One such fan is Davis Perrigo, who worked as a security guard at her concert just to see her live! Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married. Swift has been ruling the music industry for years and is behind numerous chartbuster songs such as Blank Space, Lover, Anti-Hero, and Enchanted.    Notably, her opening three-hour concert in March was attended by 70,000 people, breaking a record held by Madonna for the most-attended female concert in US history. Madonna's concert took place at Anaheim Stadium in 1987 and was attended by 62,986 people. 807", 'snippet': '... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> will possibly rank high up ... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> would possibly rank high on the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2023-05-21T10:25:14', 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l28820230521113532.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/meet-davis-perrigo-accountant-by-profession-swiftie-by-passion/story'}}, {'id': '3638057967356410941', 'title': 'Keith Urban dubs Taylor Swifts Eras Tour as best of the best', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/488544-keith-urban-dubs-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-as-best-of-the-best', 'description': 'Keith Urban attended Taylor Swifts Eras Tour with wife Nicole Kidman last weekend in Philadelphia', 'body': 'Keith Urban was all praises for Taylor Swifts\nEras Tour\nas she enjoyed her recent show with wife Nicole Kidman.\nIn an exclusive conversation with\nPeople Magazine\n, the country musician, 55, talked about attending Swifts latest show in Philadelphia on Sunday, May 14th, 2023.\nWe had the best time, Urban told the outlet.

She enjoys a massive global following, and it's not uncommon for fans to go to unimaginable lengths to catch her glimpse.    One such fan is Davis Perrigo, who worked as a security guard at her concert just to see her live! Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married.

She enjoys a massive global following, and it's not uncommon for fans to go to unimaginable lengths to catch her glimpse.    One such fan is Davis Perrigo, who worked as a security guard at her concert just to see her live! Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married. Swift has been ruling the music industry for years and is behind numerous chartbuster songs such as Blank Space, Lover, Anti-Hero, and Enchanted.    Notably, her opening three-hour concert in March was attended by 70,000 people, breaking a record held by Madonna for the most-attended female concert in US history. Madonna's concert took place at Anaheim Stadium in 1987 and was attended by 62,986 people. 807", 'snippet': '... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> will possibly rank high up ... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> would possibly rank high on the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2023-05-21T10:25:14', 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l28820230521113532.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/meet-davis-perrigo-accountant-by-profession-swiftie-by-passion/story'}}, {'id': '3638057967356410941', 'title': 'Keith Urban dubs Taylor Swifts Eras Tour as best of the best', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/488544-keith-urban-dubs-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-as-best-of-the-best', 'description': 'Keith Urban attended Taylor Swifts Eras Tour with wife Nicole Kidman last weekend in Philadelphia', 'body': 'Keith Urban was all praises for Taylor Swifts\nEras Tour\nas she enjoyed her recent show with wife Nicole Kidman.\nIn an exclusive conversation with\nPeople Magazine\n, the country musician, 55, talked about attending Swifts latest show in Philadelphia on Sunday, May 14th, 2023.\nWe had the best time, Urban told the outlet.

In my opinion, they should not wait until the day before tickets are sent by the seller.\nStubHub, a third party ticket exchange and reseller, has a policy whereby tickets are not sent to the purchaser until after the day before the event and replacement tickets are not available.\nAlmost $21,000, for better seats but of course you can see that sets me back quite a bit, Silva told the outlet.  I think it is for no reason other than incompetence through the third party or through StubHub.\nSilva, who also rented a limousine for the all-inclusive experience, was having fun at Catelynns expense before telling her about the newly acquired tickets.\nWe played a prank on them by telling them yesterday, telling them the tickets were already gone, and the look on their faces I never want to see again. One girl had a trembling lip, said Silva.\nAnthony Silva originally spent about $1,800 on the four tickets last November on StubHub, a ticket selling site, but they were never delivered and the company told him replacement seats were not available.\nWCVB\nKatelyn Silva said she was very angry and frustrated about the ticket incident because Ive been looking forward to this for nine months.\nWCVB\nCatelyn is disappointed to discover the tickets have not been delivered, causing a small tantrum over the fiasco.\nShe told the outlet, I came home playing stuff, I was so angry, so disappointed because I had been looking forward to this for nine months.\nSwift is set to spend three nights at Gillette Stadium, home of the NFLs New England Patriots, where 200,000 fans are packed. He is expected to attend.\nThe Friday show received more than 60,000 people.

She enjoys a massive global following, and it's not uncommon for fans to go to unimaginable lengths to catch her glimpse.    One such fan is Davis Perrigo, who worked as a security guard at her concert just to see her live! Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married. Swift has been ruling the music industry for years and is behind numerous chartbuster songs such as Blank Space, Lover, Anti-Hero, and Enchanted.    Notably, her opening three-hour concert in March was attended by 70,000 people, breaking a record held by Madonna for the most-attended female concert in US history. Madonna's concert took place at Anaheim Stadium in 1987 and was attended by 62,986 people. 807", 'snippet': '... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> will possibly rank high up ... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> would possibly rank high on the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2023-05-21T10:25:14', 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l28820230521113532.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/meet-davis-perrigo-accountant-by-profession-swiftie-by-passion/story'}}, {'id': '3638057967356410941', 'title': 'Keith Urban dubs Taylor Swifts Eras Tour as best of the best', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/488544-keith-urban-dubs-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-as-best-of-the-best', 'description': 'Keith Urban attended Taylor Swifts Eras Tour with wife Nicole Kidman last weekend in Philadelphia', 'body': 'Keith Urban was all praises for Taylor Swifts\nEras Tour\nas she enjoyed her recent show with wife Nicole Kidman.\nIn an exclusive conversation with\nPeople Magazine\n, the country musician, 55, talked about attending Swifts latest show in Philadelphia on Sunday, May 14th, 2023.\nWe had the best time, Urban told the outlet.

She enjoys a massive global following, and it's not uncommon for fans to go to unimaginable lengths to catch her glimpse.    One such fan is Davis Perrigo, who worked as a security guard at her concert just to see her live! Swift is currently on her nationwide The Eras Tour in the US and has been breaking records one after the other with humungous ticket sales at each event.    One such venue was Nashville's Nissan Stadium.    A Nashville resident, Perrigo, saw this as the perfect opportunity to witness her up close, and despite being an accountant, applied for a security guard job for the concert. As per News Channel 5, Perrigo decided to apply as a guard as he couldn't secure tickets as a regular fan. So, being a hardcore Swiftie, this was perhaps one of his few chances to be in the exact location as the Anti-Hero singer.    Thus, he applied for the job, got through, and enjoyed the concert, the videos of which have been going viral. Perrigo has now become something of a social media sensation himself.    I showed someone at work, like, 'Hey, this video got 10,000 views,' and by that night, it was over one million. I was like, 'OMG, this is out of control, he told the publication.    He is even receiving marriage proposals from fellow Swift fangirls drooling over his dedication.    However, Perrigo is already married. Swift has been ruling the music industry for years and is behind numerous chartbuster songs such as Blank Space, Lover, Anti-Hero, and Enchanted.    Notably, her opening three-hour concert in March was attended by 70,000 people, breaking a record held by Madonna for the most-attended female concert in US history. Madonna's concert took place at Anaheim Stadium in 1987 and was attended by 62,986 people. 807", 'snippet': '... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> will possibly rank high up ... has the most devoted fandom, <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> would possibly rank high on the ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': False, 'datePublished': '2023-05-21T10:25:14', 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://i.cdn.newsbytesapp.com/images/l28820230521113532.jpeg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'newsbytesapp', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.newsbytesapp.com/news/entertainment/meet-davis-perrigo-accountant-by-profession-swiftie-by-passion/story'}}, {'id': '3638057967356410941', 'title': 'Keith Urban dubs Taylor Swifts Eras Tour as best of the best', 'url': 'https://www.geo.tv/latest/488544-keith-urban-dubs-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-as-best-of-the-best', 'description': 'Keith Urban attended Taylor Swifts Eras Tour with wife Nicole Kidman last weekend in Philadelphia', 'body': 'Keith Urban was all praises for Taylor Swifts\nEras Tour\nas she enjoyed her recent show with wife Nicole Kidman.\nIn an exclusive conversation with\nPeople Magazine\n, the country musician, 55, talked about attending Swifts latest show in Philadelphia on Sunday, May 14th, 2023.\nWe had the best time, Urban told the outlet.
