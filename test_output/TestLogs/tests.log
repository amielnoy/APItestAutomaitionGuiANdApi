Hop on the Broad Street Line or the Orange Line and ride it south to its final stop: NRG Station, which is about a 10-minute walk from the stadium.\nRideshares such as Uber and Lyft are options, but it'll get congested the closer you are to the stadium, so setting a dropoff spot even a little bit farther from the Linc, say, near Xfinity Live!, will ease your stress.\nLeaving the stadium\nHead back the way you came; the Orange Line runs all night on weekends but doesnt run long past midnight on Sundays.\n Where to eat\nFor brunch, you can't go wrong with Parc in Rittenhouse Square, Green Eggs Caf (several locations), or\nIshkabibble's\non South Street is about a 15-minute drive from the Linc and has one of Philly's best cheesesteaks. Or if you're a little more adventurous, you could try one of these spots, personally vetted by local sammy expert Jim Pappas.\nPro tip: We recommend calling ahead to place orders as many of the city's best cheesesteaks spots get slammed, especially with large events in town.\n Chelseas thought bubble: See you there, babes!\nShare on facebook (opens in new window)\nShare on twitter (opens in new window)\nShare on linkedin (opens in new window)\nShare on nextdoor (opens in new window)\nShare on email (opens in new window)\nGet more local stories in your inbox with\nAxios", 'snippet': "... closest option for the DMV's <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> fans.

The group also attended Swifts last tour together in 2018 for her Reputation album.\nWe havent all been together in probably like two to three years, especially because of COVID,  Feltenberger said. This is like our mecca event of the decade that were all going to be together seeing the person who bonded us.\nIn addition to being the closest show to the District, Philadelphia is considered Swifts hometown show; the pop star grew up nearby in West Reading, Pennsylvania, before moving to Nashville.\nFollowing the trend of host cities welcoming Swift with offerings (\n. The work is located on the corner of 2nd and South Street in Philadelphia.\nTay-gating\nFor Swifties, the party starts in the parking lot before the opening acts.\nTay-gating is just basically tailgating, but with a funny spin on it for Taylor Swift, Feltenberger said.\nFans are pulling up to the stadium hours before the show starts, equipped with coolers and snacks. Some Tay-gaters dont have tickets for the show but plan to listen outside the stadium.\nFeltenberger said activities for Tay-gating, include,\nwalking around and seeing some of the outfits and talking to some people and maybe trading some friendship bracelets.\nMake the friendship bracelets\nInspired by a lyric in the song, Youre on Your Own Kid that calls on listeners to make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it, fans, such as Feltenberger, are coming adorned with bracelets up both wrists to exchange and give away at the show.\nI want to go above and beyond for the show because the show is above and beyond, Feltenberger said.\nAbby Korb, 24, is making a day trip to the concert from D.C. with her friends. Korb  rainbow loom and beads in hand  said her table is overtaken with craft things.\nIm not so worried about coming back with as many as Ive made, but more about making that a fun experience for somebody else, especially, kids who might be going to their first concert, Korb said.\nNever go out of style\nAnother layer of the planning is the outfits. Fans are drawing inspiration from Swifts lyrics or style of dressing throughout her different albums. Others are creating replicas of her wardrobe.\nKaitlyn McGurgan, 19, is headed to the Mothers Day Weekend concert with her mom, Lisa. In the middle of college finals week, Kaitlyn is hopping on an Amtrak train. Lisa, of Germantown, Maryland, plans to pick her daughter up from the station and drive the remainder of the way.\nFor Lisa, 53, that means red Converse shoes and a shirt that says, Its me, hi, Im the cool mom, a play on Swifts\nAnti-Hero\n lyrics, Its me, hi, Im the problem.\nShe said her daughter took a flashier approach, opting for purple reflective pants and a shirt with tassels inspired by Swifts albums Speak Now and Midnights.\nKorb is wearing a reflective red skirt and a shirt with a lyric from the song All Too Well (10-minute version) (Taylors Version), which she says shes looking forward to singing with thousands of other concertgoers.\nMy roommate and I would literally just drive around and listen to it and park the car somewhere if we were back home to finish the song, Korb said.\nLegacy\nSwifts performance includes songs from most of the 10 albums in her discography. Each show also features two surprise songs.\nSwift has released three entirely new albums since her Reputation tour along with two rerecorded albums. The pop star has been releasing re-recordings of her early albums due to a dispute over the ownership of the masters.\nOnce the rerecords of her Taylors version stuff started coming out, it was really kind of like a blast-from-the-past nostalgia for me, Korb said, who remembers listening to Swifts debut album on the ride to school as a child, singing along with her friends.\nKorb isnt alone in looking forward to hearing songs of her childhood.\nGetting to celebrate that in one tour is just like celebrating all the fans lives up into this point, which I think is really, really cool and special, Feltenberger said.\nFeltenberger\nrecalled being in elementary and middle school and looking up to Swift  even going as far as to mimic the hairstyle she wore during her time as a country artist.\nI used to curl my hair in those tight little ringlets just like her and tried to like pretend that I looked like her when I definitely didnt, and it just kind of grew from there, Feltenberger said.\nKaitlyn has similar memories of jamming to Swifts albums as a kid, specifically her hit, I Knew You Were Trouble, adding that her ability to cross genres has contributed to her success as an artist.\nI feel like theres a lot of empowerment in her songs, Kaitlyn said. Shes very confident and her songs can fit any age group, any person can relate to them.\nJessica Kronzer\nJessica Kronzer graduated from James Madison University in May 2021 after studying media and politics.

I would comp (compare) this to Flatirons Matthew Perry memoir  and a little bit to Spare by\nPrince Harry\n."\nFans are speculating that Swifts decision to use dear reader in her announcement for the re-release of her third album Speak Now (Taylors Version) was a clue that a book would follow.\nThey also claim that as the number of pages add up to the number thirteen (5+4+4), this could be a sign as that is the singers "lucky number".\nThe speculation has prompted the hashtag #TaylorSwiftBook on TikTok, which has now garnered more than one million views, as Swifties share their theories over the future release.\nMeanwhile, books shops across the US have been fueling the the rumours in a bid to cash in on the fan theories.\nSkylark Bookshop in Missouri announced the upcoming release in an Instagram post.\nCredit:\nInstagram\nSkylark Bookshop in Missouri encouraged readers to preorder now in an Instagram post featuring numerous Swift lyrics in the caption.\nThe post read: "We have something important to announce Are you ready for it?\n"On July 9th, a memoir will be released.

We wonder, is there a celebrity who has an affinity for that number? Only time will tell."\nBut one store, Blue House Books in Wisconsin, reportedly wrote that it would offer refunds to Swift fans if the book turned out to be by someone else.\nWhich may be likely as on Tuesday,\nVariety\nsaid it can report for certain that this mystery author is not, as rumoured, Taylor Swift.\nIt added: "Anyone who pre-ordered the title-less title on Amazon believing it was the pop superstar can go ahead and cancel that order now; Swift does not have a book in the offing, it can be authoritatively said."', 'snippet': '... 11 May 2023 at 9:21am <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> performs during The Eras Tour, at ... could be written by pop star <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> - despite having no solid evidence.', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2023-05-11T08:21:37', 'provider': {'name': 'itv', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://images.ctfassets.net/pjshm78m9jt4/5OjAgLOsOIyxvEuiTKoH3q/d6bcbd9c38dd70140b07f24d39b4c03b/AP23126121489761.jpg', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'itv', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.itv.com/news/2023-05-11/unknown-authors-book-storms-pre-sale-charts-after-taylor-swift-link'}}, {'id': '7615385798007781573', 'title': 'Taylor Swift book: Fans convinced singer is behind anonymous memoir scheduled for 9 July release', 'url': 'http://independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/taylor-swift-book-flatiron-mystery-b2336799.html', 'description': 'Taylor Swift book', 'body': 'Taylor Swift\nfans are convinced the singer is the author behind an anonymous non-fiction book due for release in July.\nLast week, an anonymous book quietly arrived on bookseller websites under the name 4C Untitled Flatiron Nonfiction Summer 2023.

But it seems all Taylor needs to do to pump up her streaming numbers even more is to open her mouth.\nBillboard reports that according to Luminate, the company that provides it with sales data, Taylor\'s announcement on Friday, May 5 that she was releasing Speak Now (Taylor\'s Version) immediately sent fans to their computers to stream the original album.\nLuminate says that the 17 tracks on Speak Now were streamed 6.7 million times -- an increase of 137% -- on May 6, the day after the announcement.   Among the album\'s tracks that more than doubled in streams included "Mine" -- which increased by 175% -- and "Back to December," which increased by 124%.\nStreams for the songs "Mean" and "Better than Revenge" also increased, as did "Enchanted," the one Speak Now song that Taylor has played at every Eras Tour show.\nAnd because everything associated with Taylor apparently turns to gold, streams for the British band The 1975 increased by 14% last Thursday. That was the day after those rumors that lead singer Matty Healy and Taylor were dating began.

Other times, their profile appears legit, complete with photos at previous Swift concerts. In Ma\'s experience, the would-be scammers usually start to give her a hard time when she requests to make the purchase using PayPal Goods and Services, a digital payment platform that protects buyers and sellers.\nMa, 27, of Philadelphia, wishes she could just get tickets off a verified resale site like StubHub, SeatGeek, or Vivid Seats. But with prices for Swift\'s three Philly concerts starting at $1,300 after fees on those sites, Ma said she has no choice but to brave a social media marketplace rife with con artists looking to take advantage of Swifties.\nMore than a mortgage\nA trusted secondary-market site "would definitely make me feel more assured, but the ticket prices are way too high right now," said Ma, who works in administration for an engineering firm. Despite being a lifelong fan, "it\'s not justifiable paying more than a mortgage to see her for a night."\nAs Swifties across the region get increasingly desperate this week, people like Teresa Murray worry. As consumer watchdog for the Public Interest Research Group, she has seen how tech savvy and sophisticated scammers can be  and how diehard fans can be especially vulnerable.\n"There are con artists out there that have been thinking for a long time about how to scam people, whether it\'s for Taylor Swift or Beyonc (concerts) or a 76ers playoff game," Murray said. "For a lot of people, going to a Taylor Swift concert in person makes them just desperate, and desperate people sometimes do irrational things."\nFOMO\nConcert tickets being priced so high can exacerbate FOMO, or "the fear of missing out," said Moody\'s analyst Jason Mercer. As fans scour all corners of the internet for tickets, struggling to find ones in their price range, "it\'s in their mind that this must be the best show ever."\nNo matter how desperate they are, Murray never advises fans to buy tickets from strangers on social media, recommending that they instead network in their own circles in the off-line world.\nAsk relatives, friends, neighbors, or coworkers whether they have tickets or know anyone who does. Even if you end up buying from a longtime coworker of friend, she said, there is a level of protection in knowing that your friend would be able to track the seller down in the unlikely event that they scammed you.\nWith strangers on social media, there are no guarantees, she said, and more than just the ticket cost could be on the line.\nSome scammers have started asking people to open their email and send them a code, which allows the scammer take over the person\'s email and potentially access their banking account and other personal information.\nIs it worth it?\n"There will be people who make bad decisions this week and buy fraudulent tickets, get their personal information hacked, because they wanted to go to a concert," she said. "At some point, you need to make a decision: Is it really worth it ... if you have to worry so much about whether you\'re going to get scammed?"\nFor some Swifties, the answer is yes.\nAfter encountering likely scammers for months on Facebook and Twitter, Danielle D\'Achille, 28, of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, bought two $420 tickets from someone on Facebook last week. She felt confident that the seller was legitimate, she said. The woman FaceTimed D\'Achille and sent a screen recording, showing their conversation on Facebook messenger and then a Ticketmaster account with the tickets in it.\nBy being tapped into Swiftie social media channels, D\'Achille, a project manager, said she learned to look for specific red flags, such as accounts with a profile picture allegedly showing the seller and Swift (which is believed to be taken from other people\'s profiles).\n"I\'ve been psychotic about following all this stuff," she said. "I understand if you\'re not someone who is chronically on TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, all these social media, you wouldn\'t know to look for these things."\nWhich raises the question: Is the online resale market any better, any safer for consumers, than the old-fashioned one that consisted of scalpers outside the stadium?\n"I honestly don\'t know," Murray said, noting that a scalper\'s tickets could sometimes be verified at the box office before any money was exchanged. "If I couldn\'t buy tickets from a friend or a co-worker or a relative, I think I\'d rather buy tickets from a scalper in the olden days outside the venue than some random person on Facebook Marketplace or Craigslist."\nLove', 'snippet': '... for tickets to her first <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> concert, Jasmine Ma has talked ... search for tickets to her first <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> concert, Jasmine Ma has talked to ...', 'keywords': '', 'language': 'en', 'isSafe': True, 'datePublished': '2023-05-11T14:00:00', 'provider': {'name': 'postguam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'image': {'url': 'https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postguam.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/50/d50502b8-ef9a-11ed-9df5-6fa46abd4707/645c4494c4eb2.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&amp;resize=1200%2C630&amp;order=crop%2Cresize', 'height': 0, 'width': 0, 'thumbnail': '', 'thumbnailHeight': 0, 'thumbnailWidth': 0, 'base64Encoding': '', 'name': None, 'title': None, 'provider': {'name': 'postguam', 'favIcon': '', 'favIconBase64Encoding': ''}, 'imageWebSearchUrl': None, 'webpageUrl': 'https://www.postguam.com/business/taylor-swift-fans-desperate-for-concert-tickets-are-prime-targets-for-scammers/article_a3278e1e-ef9a-11ed-85aa-d78d519f1f4f.html'}}, {'id': '5197733628533820054', 'title': "Who is Taylor Swift's famous brother Austin?

The group also attended Swifts last tour together in 2018 for her Reputation album.\nWe havent all been together in probably like two to three years, especially because of COVID,  Feltenberger said. This is like our mecca event of the decade that were all going to be together seeing the person who bonded us.\nIn addition to being the closest show to the District, Philadelphia is considered Swifts hometown show; the pop star grew up nearby in West Reading, Pennsylvania, before moving to Nashville.\nFollowing the trend of host cities welcoming Swift with offerings (\n. The work is located on the corner of 2nd and South Street in Philadelphia.\nTay-gating\nFor Swifties, the party starts in the parking lot before the opening acts.\nTay-gating is just basically tailgating, but with a funny spin on it for Taylor Swift, Feltenberger said.\nFans are pulling up to the stadium hours before the show starts, equipped with coolers and snacks. Some Tay-gaters dont have tickets for the show but plan to listen outside the stadium.\nFeltenberger said activities for Tay-gating, include,\nwalking around and seeing some of the outfits and talking to some people and maybe trading some friendship bracelets.\nMake the friendship bracelets\nInspired by a lyric in the song, Youre on Your Own Kid that calls on listeners to make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it, fans, such as Feltenberger, are coming adorned with bracelets up both wrists to exchange and give away at the show.\nI want to go above and beyond for the show because the show is above and beyond, Feltenberger said.\nAbby Korb, 24, is making a day trip to the concert from D.C. with her friends. Korb  rainbow loom and beads in hand  said her table is overtaken with craft things.\nIm not so worried about coming back with as many as Ive made, but more about making that a fun experience for somebody else, especially, kids who might be going to their first concert, Korb said.\nNever go out of style\nAnother layer of the planning is the outfits. Fans are drawing inspiration from Swifts lyrics or style of dressing throughout her different albums. Others are creating replicas of her wardrobe.\nKaitlyn McGurgan, 19, is headed to the Mothers Day Weekend concert with her mom, Lisa. In the middle of college finals week, Kaitlyn is hopping on an Amtrak train. Lisa, of Germantown, Maryland, plans to pick her daughter up from the station and drive the remainder of the way.\nFor Lisa, 53, that means red Converse shoes and a shirt that says, Its me, hi, Im the cool mom, a play on Swifts\nAnti-Hero\n lyrics, Its me, hi, Im the problem.\nShe said her daughter took a flashier approach, opting for purple reflective pants and a shirt with tassels inspired by Swifts albums Speak Now and Midnights.\nKorb is wearing a reflective red skirt and a shirt with a lyric from the song All Too Well (10-minute version) (Taylors Version), which she says shes looking forward to singing with thousands of other concertgoers.\nMy roommate and I would literally just drive around and listen to it and park the car somewhere if we were back home to finish the song, Korb said.\nLegacy\nSwifts performance includes songs from most of the 10 albums in her discography. Each show also features two surprise songs.\nSwift has released three entirely new albums since her Reputation tour along with two rerecorded albums. The pop star has been releasing re-recordings of her early albums due to a dispute over the ownership of the masters.\nOnce the rerecords of her Taylors version stuff started coming out, it was really kind of like a blast-from-the-past nostalgia for me, Korb said, who remembers listening to Swifts debut album on the ride to school as a child, singing along with her friends.\nKorb isnt alone in looking forward to hearing songs of her childhood.\nGetting to celebrate that in one tour is just like celebrating all the fans lives up into this point, which I think is really, really cool and special, Feltenberger said.\nFeltenberger\nrecalled being in elementary and middle school and looking up to Swift  even going as far as to mimic the hairstyle she wore during her time as a country artist.\nI used to curl my hair in those tight little ringlets just like her and tried to like pretend that I looked like her when I definitely didnt, and it just kind of grew from there, Feltenberger said.\nKaitlyn has similar memories of jamming to Swifts albums as a kid, specifically her hit, I Knew You Were Trouble, adding that her ability to cross genres has contributed to her success as an artist.\nI feel like theres a lot of empowerment in her songs, Kaitlyn said. Shes very confident and her songs can fit any age group, any person can relate to them.\nJessica Kronzer\nJessica Kronzer graduated from James Madison University in May 2021 after studying media and politics.

(Someone guessed the Chargers\' bolt stood for "Lightning McQueen.")\nWhereas virtually every NFL franchise produced some sort of slick video to roll out its slate of games, the Titans stole the show with their rough-hewn clips shot with a smartphone and a lapel microphone. Actually, Tennessee made one of those highly produced videos too, but wanted more of a Gen-Z offering for various social media platforms.\nPeople are also reading\nNapaStat | $17.95 million: That\'s the price of Napa Countys most expensive home sold in April\nAs of Saturday afternoon, the viral street video had 9.3 million views on Twitter, 4.8 million on TikTok, 1.4 million on Instagram and 436,000 on Facebook.\n"Not to brag," said Gil Beverly, chief marketing and strategy officer for the Titans, "but we kind of created a moment."\nBeverly credited a trio of twentysomethings in the front office  Emily Starkey, Katie Moseley and Jeanette Morley  for coming up with the idea and shooting the video. Nate Bain, who came from the Rams, is the team\'s director of social media.\nStarkey, Moseley and Morley spent eight hours over two days talking to people around the time Taylor Swift was in town for a concert. Apparently, the Venn diagram of NFL fans and Swifties has some areas that don\'t overlap.\nAmong the more amusing guesses, the Atlanta Falcons were the "Red Stallions," Cincinnati Bengals were the "Boston Bobcats," the New Orleans Saints were the "St. Louis Rams," and a group of young women confidently proclaimed the Indianapolis Colts horseshoe stood for  the Dallas Cowboys.\nWhat made the video hilarious was after each blind stab, the Titans would announce the actual game  over the soundtrack of the triumphant trill of the Fox NFL theme song  using the goofy guess.\nSo the Nov. 2 game against Pittsburgh was announced as a matchup with the "49ers 69ers Stars," the Nov. 12 game versus Tampa Bay is against the "Pirates from the Islands of the Caribbean." The division-rival Jacksonville Jaguars are either "Chester Cheeto" or "Actually Does Not Exist," and the Seattle Seahawks are the "Eagles Eagles Eagles from Pittsburgh."\nOne young man described the Cleveland Browns as "Just the Football Logo," although a guess that didn\'t make the cut was the "Ohio Eights."\nAt the end, of course, all the fans could identify the Tennessee Titans.\nAfter the video was released, some of the teams involved played along. The Falcons even changed their social media handle to the Red Stallions, and the Colts briefly changed their name on Twitter to "not the Cowboys."\n"I saw a local T-shirt company that\'s already making a T-shirt with all the fake names," Beverly said. "It\'s a 15-minutes-of-fame kind of thing, and this one seems to have a little bit of legs to it, and we\'re going to enjoy it while it lasts."\nTags', 'snippet': '... spent eight hours over two days talking to people around the time <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> was in town for a concert.

The Twitter account Taylor Swift News agreed, sharing it with the message, Taylor saying hi to Blake and Ryans children James and Inez whilst on stage.\nAside from the onstage moment at the Philadelphia show, fans saw the two Lively-Reynolds kids backstage with their mom, according to\nPeople\n. The girls were reportedly holding hands with Swift on her way out, waving goodbye to fans. Their two younger sisters missed out, which is fitting given that Betty is just 3 and the baby was born in February.\nSwift is famously close to Lively, Reynolds, and the four children they now have. She used James and Inezs names, plus Bettys for her 2020 song Betty. They even got a shoutout when she won Album of the Year at the 2021 Grammy Awards, along with their parents, whom she called the second and third people I play every new song that I write [for], per MTV News.\nThe girls parents think its pretty d*mn amazing that Swift used their names in Betty, Reynolds said during a SiriusXM interview in August 2021. He called it an honor and knew they could trust her with it. They surprised their kids by not telling them about their names in the song until it was done. They didnt know. They had no idea, he said.\nLets not forget that Swift recorded baby James voice for the intro to 2017s Gorgeous.

It was in this hallowed space (initially built as a carriage house in 1870) where, as Swift sings, she memorized the creaks in the floor. The going theory among Swifties is that the song documents Swifts early romance with her ex Joe Alwyn.\nIn the song, Swift reveals that if you ever walk away, Id never walk Cornelia Street again. Now, one month after the couple split, the apartment is back in the spotlight as its real estate broker drums up publicity in TMZ. All this can be yours, for $45,000 per month.\nThis is Swifts lot in life, so to speak. Much like anything else that celebrities do these days, real estate has become subject to constant reporting. In an era when many millennials with lingering memories of marathoning Cribs now spend their time wistfully scrolling through Zillow, real estate has also become a part of celebrities brands.\nSwifts notoriously plush real estate portfoliowhich the Wall Street Journal tallied at $150 million earlier this yearhas helped tell her story for more than a decade. Theyve helped define her aesthetic and become part of her lore. Through the years, the singer has woven her homes and their own histories into her music and, conversely, used her real estate purchases to weave herself into their histories too.\nSince the beginning of her career, Swifts so-called authenticity has been at the heart of her detractors skepticismand wealth has long played a part in sowing that mistrust. In spite of the \nunderdog\n narrative that the singer cultivated early in her career, some critics pointed out that she was born into considerable money: Her mother is a former marketing manager, and her father, a Merrill Lynch stockbroker, descends from three generations of bank presidents, according to the New Yorker. An aptly titled 2016 post from The Ringer asked, When Did You First Realize Taylor Swift Was Lying to You?\nIt should come as no surprise, given her family history, that as Swifts album sales rose, she began to park some of that cash into real-estate investments.\nBeverly Hills (and Nashville): Thats where Taylor wants to be\nEver the industrious one, Swift made her first purchase at age 20, when the Wall Street Journal reports that she purchased her Nashville condo on Nashvilles Music Row for $2.377M in 2009.\nSwift cobbled her 5,000 square-foot starter home together by purchasing two unitsa construction endeavor to which she would later return, much to the consternation of some of her neighbors in Tribeca years later.\nThe eye-catching abode, seen in Swifts 2020 Netflix documentary Miss Americana, was basically the godmother of grand-millennial design. Swifts zest for something different from everywhere else I seedescribed by journalist Jody Rosen for Vulture as an eye-popping cacophony of patterned wallpaper and fabricsforetold current interior design trends toward all things vintage and maximalist and helped solidify her accessible, lightly quirky girl brand.\nAs Swift picked out tiles and wallpapers in 2009, she described her decorative instincts as whimsical quirky eclectic tree house. Four years later, Rosen described the final product as a Shabby-Chic Alice in Wonderland.\nIn 2010, Swifts star soared with Speak Nowwhich defied downward trends in album sales and sold 1,047,000 copies in the US in its first week. The triumph of Swifts album ushered in a new chapter in her real estate story as well. Well call 2011 her Ive arrived era.\nThat year, Swift bought her first home in Beverly Hills. In keeping with her dreamy, proto-cottagecore brand, Swift managed to find perhaps the only Cape Cod-style home in the 90210 for $3.55 million, the Journal reports. Swift also bought a $2.5 million mansion for her parents in 2011a Greek Revival structure called the Northumberland Estate. (Our Tay-Tay really loves her idiosyncratic architectural styles!) A year later, Swift dropped another $1.775  million for a second house in Beverly Hills to use for guestsyou know, as one does.\nWhen Swift finally welcomed Vogue to her home for a round of \n73 Questions\n in 2016, she did so at her Beverly Hills estate. The wallpaper was out in full force, and apparently T-Swift keeps a VMA trophy next to her coffee maker. The garden? Stunning. The accents feel like a throwback to the days when Pier 1 was it for suburban interior design, and the lighting is warm and cozy. It was all perfectly curated, and it all screamed Taylor Swift.\nPut together, the Nashville and Beverly Hills properties solidified Swifts purchasing power and demonstrated what her fans and savvy critics already knew: She wasnt going anywhere.\nTaylor moves inand outof Cape Cod\nThen came the time Swift dated a Kennedy. In August 2012, months before she released her smash album Red and six weeks into her relationship with Conor Kennedy, Swift bought a $4.9 million home on Cape Cod, across the street from the Kennedy compound. In the book The Kennedy Heirs, a friend of Conors said that Swifts purchase made him nervous: It seemed as if she was getting a little too attached, spending five million bucks on a house just to be near the guy.\nChatter about Swifts dating life was at its most pervasive around the time Red debuted. By then, shed dated a string of A-listers, including Jake Gyllenhaal, John Mayer, Taylor Lautner, and Harry Styles, and woven many of them into some of her best songs.\nIn retrospect, Swifts brief stint in the Cape Cod beach homeand the discussion around itfeels like a relic from the bygone era before Blank Space, when gossip about her relationships was as pervasive as reviews of her music. In the end, however, Swift got the last laugh on this one; as quickly as she sold her coastal pad, she still walked away with an $870 million profit.\nMiss Taymerica\nPerhaps the most crucial real estate investment of Swifts career so far came in 2013, when she bought her Rhode Island mansion for $17.75 million. This would become the stage for the brand-defining tradition Taymerica. The annual Fourth of July event first made news in 2014, thanks in part to the rise of Swifts Girl Squad.\nThis was the time of Bad Blood, Mad Max-style costumes, and power in girlbossy numbers. The Girl Squad was Swift at her most controversial, and Taymerica was its nexus. Lena Dunham was on deck at Taymerica 2014, as were Gossip Girl star Jessica Szohr, Emma Stone, Andrew Garfield, You & I singer Ingrid Michaelson, and Swifts The Giver co-star Odeya Rush.\nThe parties seemed, in a way, like Swifts armor against the constant chatter of her criticsphotographic evidence that some people, at least, liked her just fine, thankyouverymuch!\nSwifts Rhode Island h', 'snippet': '... titled 2016 post from The Ringer asked, When Did You First Realize <b><b>Taylor Swift</b></b> Was Lying to You?

See what happens next", 'url': 'https://abc7news.com/taylor-swift-stubhub-tickets-concert/13240821/', 'description': "Two Bay Area moms bought Taylor Swift concert tickets on StubHub for their 13-year-old daughters, but StubHub told them it didn't have the tickets.", 'body': 'More Videos\n\nTwo Bay Area moms bought Taylor Swift concert tickets on StubHub for their 13-year-old daughters, but StubHub told them it didn\'t have the tickets.\nSAN FRANCISCO (KGO) --\nFor Taylor Swift fans, there\'s little more coveted than tickets to her latest concert tour. They sold out before general public could even try to buy one.\nHowever, two Bay Area moms scored tickets on StubHub for their 13 year old daughters-and excitement ran high - until it turned to heartbreak.\n"Every day we\'d say, get the tickets, get the tickets, we wanted them so bad,\'\' 13-year-old Olivia Schuman recalled.\nThe young teen and her friend since birth, Sasha Malek, have been Taylor Swift fans nearly their entire lives. Now, their mothers are fans too.\nSo, when they heard the superstar was going on tour this year, the two moms decided to take their daughters to see her in concert.\n"To have your 13-year-old daughters want to do anything like this with their mothers, and be excited, it\'s like seeing yourself through them,\'\' said Olivia\'s mom, Isabelle Schuman, who is also longtime friends with Sasha\'s mom.\n"We both like Taylor Swift. Our daughters like it, I thought it would be fun,\'\' Schuman recalled. "I said, are you in? Let\'s go to L.A., a girl\'s trip."\nMORE:\nThe tour had sold out in minutes last November, so Schuman went to the StubHub secondary marketplace and bought four tickets to the show in Los Angeles, their seats not far from the stage.\nExctement quickly grew.\n"They\'re already talking about what outfit they wanted to wear, and what we should wear, and how we\'re gonna do heir hair,\'\' Schuman said. "Apparently when you go to a Taylor Swift concert you dress up in the clothes that go with the theme of her albums."\n"We\'re gonna do this, like, glitter heart around our eye,\'\' Olivia said, tracing a heart shape with her finger around one eye.\n"We got airline tickets, we booked a hotel, the girls were super excited and so were we."\nBut six months later, a crushing letdown.\n"StubHub came to us and said ...we don\'t have tickets for you," Schuman recalled\nMORE:\nSix months after she bought and paid for the tickets, Isabelle received an email from StubHub saying "We apologize, but unfortunately your seller is not able to provide the tickets you originally purchased."\n"I was shocked,\'\' Schuman said "Why are they just telling us now six months later?"\nSuddenly, they had no tickets. And no explanation. Just disappointed teens and wasted airline tickets.\nStubHub\'s Fan Protection Guarantee says if a sale falls through, fans are entitled to a full refund, or "comparable-or-better tickets."\nBut "comparable" means a similar price - and at the current, going rates. And of course Taylor Swift ticket prices have skyrocketed since Schuman bought her tickets back in November.\nShe\'d paid $3,400 for four seats including fees last November. Right now, comparable seats listed for anywhere from $13,000 to $17,000, including StubHub fees, for the Los Angeles date.\n"Why did I buy my ticket six months ago,\'\' Schuman said. "There\'s no guarantee. Yeah, get my money back, but you\'re not guaranteed your ticket.\nMORE:\nNow I had to go back and tell the girls, they were disappointed. Sad."\n"It was upsetting, it just felt not fair,\'\' Sasha\'s mother Jessica said.\nSchuman complained by direct message to StubHub saying,  "We aren\'t even guaranteed to get tickets. How do you tell a 13-year-old that?"\nStubHub replied, "Regrettably, we are required to follow our policies...the section you purchased has gone up three times what you paid. We can\'t issue replacements. Unfortunately I cannot guarantee tickets."\n"They said they have no control,\'\' Schuman said. ...it\'s the seller. It\'s coming from the seller"\nSchuman had planned to present the tickets to Olivia at her bat-mitzvah this month. Now there were no tickets at all.\nShe contacted ABC7, and 7 On Your Side team asked StubHub how it allows a seller to renege on the sale of tickets.\nStubHub said sellers do face penalties if they remove a ticket from the platform after it\'s been sold. They also are not allowed to cancel a sale and then raise the price, which is what Schuman suspected was happening, since it\'s possible to fetch a much higher price for those seats.\nThe fan guarantee does not include replacing tickets at a higher price.\nWhich means it\'s not always possible to count on those seats.\nMORE:\n\'Excruciating for me\': Taylor Swift speaks out on Instagram after Ticketmaster cancels general sale\nHowever, StubHub did take action.\n"An hour and a half (after contacting ABC7), I got a phone call from StubHub,\'\' Schuman recalled. "They were gonna help me out."\nStubHub came through with four seats in a section similar to their good seats nearer the stage -- for no extra cost. And at the bat mitzvah party, Schuman handed Olivia and Sasha an envelope.\n"Girls there\'s something exciting for you,\'\' Schuman told them.\n"What is it?"  the girls replied.\nThey opened the envelope, precious tickets were tucked inside. Joyful shrieks erupted from the group. (see video)\n"ABC7 helped us," the moms said. "Thank you, ABC7!"\nStubHub could not say why the seller did not release the tickets, or if the person was hoping to fetch a higher price.\nStubHub says it does penalize sellers who fail to provide tickets after they\'re sold, or who cancel a sale and then raise the price.\nOur thanks to StubHub for the new tickets.
