(WCCO) - Taylor Swift fans are struggling to find ways to and from next weekends concert after learning Metro Transit will not extend light rail and bus service after the show.\nThousands of fans say they were counting on public transportation to get them downtown and back.\nA Swifty fan since debut in 2006, Ive been to every single show, every single time she has toured, said fan Kassandra Vilchis.\nFor Vilchis, the excitement is building. Her favorite artist will land next weekend in Minneapolis and U.S. Bank Stadium for a stop on her world tour.\nBut some fans are not happy after learning theres no extended transit service to get them home after the music stops.\nTrains cant operate without operators, said Metro Transits Drew Kerr.\nMetro Transit has moved thousands into and out of downtown Minneapolis during the Super Bowl, the Final Four and other concerts.\nWhen we have these late nights, people coming after the service is scheduled to stop, thats where we have some challenges, Kerr said.\nMetro Transit says it has 85 operators, barely enough to accommodate the existing rail schedule.\nWe are very committed to the service thats on the schedule, of course. The last trips that leave U.S. Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis here depart about 11:30 p.m., so we hope that there are people that will be able to utilize those trips, Keer said.\nSwifties took to social media to vent. Some say advanced planning could have gone a long way.\nIts kind of a bummer because, you know, I could have used my bus pass, gotten on the Metro Transit, came down here early for all the like fun activities and energy, and then left after the show, Vilchis said. You could have made a swift decision and maybe had some incentives to get people to work later.\nWhile fans will make due, some spending extra on parking or a night at a hotel, their frustration with public transportation may take time to fade.\nMetro Transit says its hiring train operators directly instead of using the traditional route of having them drive a bus first.\nSwifties can check out Minnesota Valley Transit Authority for special day-of-concert rides from the suburbs to downtown Minneapolis.\nCopyright 2023 KVLY.

Using a wheelchair, the El Camino senior crossed the stage with the rest of her classmates.\nNow, she has turned to social media to bridge her next divide.\n"I recommended her to do it because she saw another fan in another state, have a similar problem with a stadium for the same concert," said her father, George.\nThe problemrefers to is Taylor Swift tickets.Ariana is a mega fan of the mega star.\n"She started writing when she was around my age. So, went through all the things Im going through now. If that makes sense. She kind of experienced everything," she said.\nSince birth, Ariana has experienced the random inequity of life.In 2007, KTVU introduced us to her, and the rare genetic disease, called Morquio Syndrome, that has ravaged her body and stunted her growth.But researchers have been able tosynthesize a treatment. Since then,Ariana has not only survived, shes thrived.\nWhich brings us back to Taylor Swift.To attend the songstress Jul. 29 concert at Levis Stadium, shell need Americans with Disability Act (ADA) seating.\n"For the disabled community, there needs to be access. There needs to be a different level of accessthat some other constituents just take for granted in their daily lives," said Christopher Hickey, a division manager in the San Jose Office of Equity Assurance.\nLast November, when Ticketmaster crashed selling tickets, her dad was only able to snag standard seating.\n"You have to email our ADA exchange department. And request how many tickets. And basically its a first come, first served type of thing," said George Kallas.\nBy the time Kallasclicked the buy button, the ADA tickets were sold out. Experts said one percent of the tickets are supposed to be earmarked for ADA seating. But its unclear whos supposed to enforce that  the venue, the artist, or the ticket purveyor?\nFox 2 contacted Ticketmaster about this situation, and received an automated form emailed response.\nThe San Francisco 49ers, who operate the stadium, wrote in an email,\n"ADA seats were made available as part of the original on-sale and have been completely sold out to fans requiring various accommodations. We are continuing to explore potential solutions..."\nGeorge Kallas said hes prepared to carry his 18-year-old daughter to a standard seat. But both hope public pressure, and maybe even an appeal to Swift herself, will help pave a more gracefulway into the show.\n"She advocates for a lot of people. She advocates for LGBTQ+ community and a lot of things. I dont know, use your voice and kind of help us too. Were people," said Ariana.\nJesse Gary is a reporter based in the station\'s South Bay bureau.
